=========================

Coursera course getting_and_cleaning_data

Just start up the scri√ºt run_analysis.R and you are ready to go to make the data cleaning on the dataset work; it also downloads the data for you. 
For a more detailed description just read the Codebook.md file in this folder.

If you want a deeper view of the variable-name cleaning step please view the run_analysis.R file also, because the regex-work is very easy to understand from the code.

Thanks for reading this file and working with me in this nice course.
I wish you all the best for your grading.
